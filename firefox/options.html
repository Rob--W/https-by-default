HTTPS is enabled by default for all navigations from the location bar and bookmarks.
If a site does not support https, you can opt in to using http by default for that site by adding the domain to the following list.
When https by default is turned off for a domain, its subdomains will also not use https by default.
<textarea id="domains_nohttps_input"></textarea>
<input id="save_button" type="button" value="Save">
